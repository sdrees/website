Erlang and Elixir technology is at the heart of many of the world’s leading tech stacks! Join us at [Code BEAM STO](https://www2.codesync.global/l/23452/2020-02-04/6w4y9d) (Stockholm, 28-29 May 2020), the only conference in Europe to bring Erlang, Elixir, and all of the languages on the Erlang VM together! 

2020 themes include Web and APIs, Frameworks, Scalability, Reliability, Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and integrating third party services. Learn from 50+ cutting-edge talks and our in-depth training program, how BEAM languages are revolutionising areas like IoT, Blockchain, Fintech, Security, Machine Learning and more.
